# Accessibility

The GOV.UK Technical Documentation Template and its documentation are maintained by the technical writing team at the Government Digital Service (GDS).

## Accessibility statement for the Technical Documentation Template documentation website

This accessibility statement applies to the documentation at [https://tdt-documentation.london.cloudapps.digital/](https://tdt-documentation.london.cloudapps.digital/).

This website is run by GDS. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without problems
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

### How accessible this website is

We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible because of [issues caused by our Technical Documentation Template](#using-the-technical-documentation-template-for-your-own-documentation).

We’re committed to making this website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

#### Feedback and contact information

If you need information on this website in a different format like accessible PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording or braille, email [technical-writers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:technical-writers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

We’ll consider your request and get back to you in 3 working days.

##### Reporting accessibility problems with this website

We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, email [technical-writers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:technical-writers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

##### Enforcement procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, [contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/).

#### Technical information about this website’s accessibility

##### Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard.

### Preparation of this accessibility statement

This statement was prepared on 2 September 2020. It was last reviewed on 23 June 2021.

This website was last tested in March 2021.

## Using the Technical Documentation Template for your own documentation

This [Technical Documentation Template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template) was last tested in April 2021. The test was carried out by the [Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC)](https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/).

DAC tested the [GovWifi technical documentation](https://docs.wifi.service.gov.uk/), which uses this Technical Documentation Template.

This Technical Documentation Template is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard due to the non-compliances listed below.

- In some circumstances, the main page heading is automatically in focus when the page loads. This means keyboard-only users may miss the navigation elements. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.3 - Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order.html).
- The navigation elements are not marked up semantically as hierarchical headings, which means moving through the navigation using a screen reader may be more difficult. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 - Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html).
- There are sections of content with show / hide functionality. The `aria-expanded` attribute is not implemented correctly, so users may miss that menu items are expandable. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 - Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value.html).
- When a user searches, the search results dialogue hides the main page region from assistive technology. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.2.2 - On Input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/on-input.html) and [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.3 - Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order.html).

We plan to fix these issues by 31 July 2021.

While GDS takes steps to ensure the Technical Documentation Template is as accessible as possible by default, you still need to carry out contextual research.

You’ll still need to make sure your documentation as a whole meets accessibility requirements. You must research your documentation content to ensure that it’s in context.
