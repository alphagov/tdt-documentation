# Setting up redirects

If you do something that changes the URL of a page in your documentation, you should set up a redirect to the new URL. Redirecting means that other places linking to your old URL will end up to your new one.

For example, if you restructure the page hierarchy in you documentation, URLs will change, and you should set up redirects.

The Tech Docs Template allows you to set up redirects in either:

- the [global configuration file][global-config]
- the [frontmatter of the page][frontmatter] whose URL changed
- your []`config.rb` file][redirect-configrb]

<%= partial "partials/links" %>
