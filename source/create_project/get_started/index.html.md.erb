# Get started Beth

The following instructions assume that you have a Mac laptop.

You must set up the following on your local machine:

- administrator rights
- [Xcode command line interface tools][xcode]
- [Ruby programming language][ruby]
- [Middleman static site generator][middleman]

## Administrator rights on your laptop

If you are a Government Digital Service (GDS) employee, raise a ticket on the [GDS Web Help Desk] to request administrator rights on your laptop.

If you are not a GDS employee, follow your internal IT processes.

## Install Xcode command line interface tools

1. Go to [Apple Developer Downloads].
1. Search for "Xcode".
1. Select the appropriate __Command Line Tools (macOS x.x) for Xcode x.x__ and download the file.
1. Install the file.

If you have a software centre for your department, you should be able to install the Xcode command line tools through this software centre.

## Install Node.js

You can install [Node.js][node] to any location on your local machine.

## Install Ruby

You can install [Ruby][ruby] to any location on your local machine.

You can install Ruby in multiple ways, for example using [Ruby Version Manager][rvm] (RVM) or [rbenv]. These instructions assume you are using RVM.

1. Run the following in the command line to install the ruby version manager:

    ```yaml
    \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
    ```

1. Check the [Ruby downloads page][ruby-downloads] for the latest version of Ruby.

1. Run `rvm install ruby-x.x.x` to install the latest version of [Ruby][ruby], where `x.x.x` is the Ruby version number. For example, `rvm install ruby-2.6.1`.

You can install [Middleman][middleman] to any location on your local machine.

Run the following in the command line to install Middleman:

```yaml
