# Enable and configure the cookie banner

If you want to store cookies in your project, you can enable the cookie banner to obtain a user's consent before storing the cookies.

This cookie banner is based on the [GOV.UK Design System cookie banner component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/cookie-banner/).

## Required cookie banner settings

To show the cookie banner and obtain the right cookie consent you must:

- enable the cookie banner
- set the cookie types to store

### Enable cookie banner

To enable the cookie banner in your project, add the following code to `config/tech-docs.yml` file:

```yaml
cookie_banner:
  enable: true
```

The cookie banner is not enabled by default. You can disable the cookie banner by setting `enable: false`.

### Set cookie types

You must set the type or types of cookie to store.

Setting this also sets which cookie banner copy text and button text is shown to the user.

To set the type or types of cookies to store, add the following code to `config/tech-docs.yml` file:

```yaml
cookie_banner:
  cookie_types: ['<COOKIE TYPE>']
```

There are 3 types of cookie:

- essential, with a cookie type of `essential`
- analytics, with a cookie type of `analytics`
- non-essential, with a cookie type of `additional`

You can set one or multiple types of cookies to store. For example, to store all types of cookie:

```yaml
cookie_banner:
  cookie_types: ['essential', 'analytics', 'additional']
```

See the [GOV.UK Design System cookie banner component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/cookie-banner/) page for more information.

## Optional cookie banner settings

You can set the following optional cookie banner settings:

- cookie banner message text
- cookie page URL

### Set cookie banner message text

You can replace the default text in the cookie banner with custom text.

Add the following code to `config/tech-docs.yml` file:

```yaml
cookie_banner:
  cookie_message_text: |
    <CUSTOM TEXT>
```

You can create single or multiple paragraphs, and have line breaks inbetween the paragraphs. For example:

```yaml
# Enable cookie banner
cookie_banner:
  enable: true
  cookie_types: ['essential', 'analytics']
  cookie_message_text: |
    I love cookies
    Chocolate chip are my favourite

    I love ginger biscuits
    I call them biscuits, not cookies
```

### Set cookie page URL

You can set a custom URL for your cookie page. The default value is `'/cookies'`.

Add the following code to `config/tech-docs.yml` file:

```yaml
cookie_banner:
  cookie_page_path: <CUSTOM COOKIE PAGE URL>
```
