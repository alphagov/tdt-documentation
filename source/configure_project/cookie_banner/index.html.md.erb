# Enable and configure the cookie banner

If you are planning on storing cookies in your project, you can enable the cookie banner to obtain user's consent prior to storing them.

The provided cookie banner is based on the [GOV.UK Design System cookie banner component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/cookie-banner/).

### Required cookie banner settings

To show the cookie banner and obtain the right consent for the cookies you're looking to store there are some required settings.

### Enable cookie banner

To enable the cookie banner in your project, add the following lines to `config/tech-docs.yml` file:

```yaml
cookie_banner: 
  enable: true
```

By default the cookie banner is not enabled. You also can turn off the cookie banner by setting `enable: false`.

### cookie_types

Set the type or types of cookies you wish to store.

This setting controls which cookie banner copy and button text is shown as described on the [GOV.UK Design System cookie banner component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/cookie-banner/) page.

`cookie_types` accepts an array with the following values

```yaml
cookie_banner:
  cookie_types: ['essential', 'analytics', 'additional']
```
If you're only storing essential cookies, set `['essential']`.

If you're storing essential and analytics cookies, set `['essential', 'analytics']`.

If youâ€™re storing more than one type of non-essential cookie, set `['essential', 'analytics', 'additional']`.

## Optional cookie banner settings

Cookie banner component is set with some defaults for essential, analytics and additional cookies.
All of them can be replaced with custom text.

### cookie_message_text

If you are storing non-essential cookies and wish to fully customise the text, you can create a multiline
text, which will create new lines and paragarphs. This will replace all the default text.

```yaml
cookie_banner:
  cookie_message_text: |
    Paragraph 1
    New line in paragraph 1

    Paragraph 2
```

### cookie_page_path

Set a custom url to your cookies page. Default value is '/cookies'.

```yaml
cookie_banner:
  cookie_page_path: /link-to-cookies-page
```

## All available configuration options

Below are listed all the options for the cookie banner that can be set.

```yaml
cookie_banner: 
  enable: true
  cookie_types: ['essential','analytics', 'additional']
  cookie_message_text: |
    Paragraph 1
    New line in paragraph 1

    Paragraph 2
```
